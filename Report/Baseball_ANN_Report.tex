\section{Abstract}
  This report will review our implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for use predicting the run differentials of baseball games. The ANN was implemented in Common Lisp, using a simple design with a single hidden layer. The ANN was trained and tested on public, game-level MLB data. INSERT STATEMENT ABOUT RESULTS

\section{Objective}     % section 1.1
Our objective was to create an ANN that could predict the outcomes of baseball games given input data with relatively reliable results.
